# Javascript_recepies

The repository contains code for a dynamic web page. The page is a cookbook. It contains a list
of the recepies. You can look up a recipe in the list using searching field, you can filter
the recepies by category and you can sort them by their rating.

This code was created as a final project of the javascript course organized by Czechitas (https://www.czechitas.cz/en/).
I was provided by the files with html, css and by a list of the recepies. My task was to make the page dynamic (code in app.js).
